              In the misty hills of Kodagu (Coorg), a land renowned for its
              robust coffee, the air carrying the intoxicating scent of
              cardamom, the sharp tang of pepper and vibrant orange groves along
              with more robust people, lies a story of resilience and
              achievement. This is the tale of a clan whose roots run as deep as
              the verdant valleys of their homeland.
            </p>

            <p>
              Among the twelve proud divisions (kombu) of Kodagu, spread across
              thirty-five diverse lands (naad), stands Kadiyathnaad. Here, Male
              Thambran reigns from atop the dense, mist-shrouded mountain that
              pierce the heavens and watches over his children, our clan has
              flourished for some 350 years, their history intertwined with the
              very soil of the Bolli division (Bolli kombu) in Kokeri village.
            </p>

            <p>
              The clan&apos;s saga begins with Godhari Utthaiah, the founding
              father whose legacy would grow to touch countless lives. As his
              descendants multiplied, they branched out like the strong arms of
              a banyan tree, each new generation adding to the clan&apos;s rich
              tapestry.
            </p>

            <p>
              The main branch of the family took root in Kirundad village and
              further rooted on the soil of Mukkati in Kokeri village. But the
              clan members were not content to remain in one place. With the
              spirit of adventure that Kodagu is famous for, other branches of
              the family ventured forth, establishing new homes and livelihoods,
              acquiring lands in Kodambur, Banavara, Aluru Siddapura, Haleri,
              and Hassan.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the generations, our clan has not merely survived; it has
              thrived, leaving an indelible mark on the region and beyond. The
              clan&apos;s sons and daughters have distinguished themselves in
              diverse fields, from the arts to sciences, from literature to
              cultural, from sports to war field, their achievements echoing the
              indomitable spirit of their ancestors.

              The story of this remarkable clan is more than a family chronicle;
              it&apos;s a celebration of the Kodagu spirit. It speaks of people
              who honor their past while fearlessly embracing the future, who
              remain rooted in tradition even as they reach for the stars. In

              itself â€” proud, resilient, and ever-evolving.
